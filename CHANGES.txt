Revision history for MySQL-Time-Machine

Release 0.9.9  Date/Time: 2016-04-22

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Parallelized the mutations generator since that was the CPU bottleneck. Now
      Initial snapshots are order of magnitude faster.

    [MINOR ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Make delta tables config optional
    - Change in the salting algorithim:
        -> instead of first two bytes we use first 4 bytes of md5
        -> instead '-' we use ';' to connect salt with the rest of the key

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Tables created in different timezones are now supported, so default
      timestamp won't be invalid in active_schema timezone
    - Removed the limit for maximum KeyValue size in HBase so put won't brake
      on large blobs
    - Dont create daily yyyymmdd tables if table is not listed in yml config
    - Fix for empty buffer-on-rotate event bug
    - Fixed a bug for counter increment (that would occasionaly be skiped) for
      table-level metrics
    - Fixed a bug with init for table-totals metric which resulted in occasionally
      some metrics being lost witch resulted in checkpoint not being passed
    - Fix bug which identified some DDL statements as commit or begin
    - Fix checkpoint test for case when --delta is off

Release 0.9.8  Date/Time: 2016-04-01

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Added daily changes tables in HBase. Usefull for imports to hive
        - Added table level counters
        - Added check point tests on binlog rotate event
        - Added "Chaos Monkey" which fails HBase Applier tasks in 1% of the cases

        [MINOR ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Added option for end-binlog-file

        [BUG FIXES]
        - Handle OpenReplicator bug that produces two rotate events per one binlog file

Release 0.9.7  Date/Time: 2016-02-26

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Added hbase-applier-tasks metrics
        - Added counter-totals metrics
        - Added initial-snapshot option

        [MINOR ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Refactored hbase applier to prepare structure for future features
        - More debug info added to STDOUT applier
        - Better naming of metrics

        [BUG FIXES]
        - fix for missing rows of the last task of initial snapshot in
          the case when COMMIT query event does not contain database name.
        - fix for NullPointer exception in ReplicatorMetrics.

Release 0.9.6  Date/Time: 2016-02-11

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Added replication delay metric.

        [MINOR ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Renamed Counters.java to Metrics.java since not all of the metrics are Counters.

        [BUG FIXES]
        - Handling utf8 and latin1 for MySQL TEXT types.
        - MySQL BLOB handling: hex-ify and store as hex string in HBase.
        - Timestamp handling: Store timestamp as a long number in HBase,
          instead of its date-time representation in local timezone.

Release 0.9.5  Date/Time: 2016-02-02

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Restructured uuidBufer design, for better performance and adaptability
          to two distinct load patters (many small transactions vs few very large
          transactions).
        - Refactored metrics code. Added additional metrics and clear naming for
          clear distinction between event-level counters and row-level counters
        - For updated rows store only the changed cells.
        - Added operation type markers: 'U' marker for updates, 'I' marker for
          inserts and 'D' marker for deletes. Markers are stored in column 'd:row_status'

        [MINOR ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Better naming for some variables and new constants added
        - shard number can be specified on startup as part of schema name

        [BUG FIXES]
        - Fixed regex for enum column definition parsing
        - handle Time2Column OpenReplicator type in type converter
        - For deleted rows all columns should be ignored (which was not the case).

Release 0.9.4  Date/Time: 2015-12-29

        [INITIAL COMMIT]
        - Open sourcing the code - initial commit of early beta/alpha code base
